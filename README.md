Django and React Boilerplate For Building Modern Web Applications

This project uses Django, Webpack and React 

## Why Using This Boilerplate

When building modern web applications using Django and Django REST framework you'll need to use a modern front end library such as React. But the process of integrating React with Django can be intimidating for the first time. That's why I created this boilerplate project to allow you to focus on what you want to build instead of wasting hours to figure out how to glue Django and React.


This project can be used as a starting point for a modern application with Django and Django REST framework on the backend and React with Webpack on the front end. You need just to clone the project then follow some easy instructions to get up and running.
